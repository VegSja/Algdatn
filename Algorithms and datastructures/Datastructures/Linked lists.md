# Linked lists
- Nodes that point to the next (and maybe the previous)
- Takes linear time to lookup a given position
- Constant time to insert/remove elements

| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| List-search(L,K) | Find node with key k                                                    | O(n)       |
| List-insert      | Insert node x as new HEAD in list l                                     | O(1)       |
| List-delete      | Delete node from list (prev node point to next, next point to previous) | O(1)       |
